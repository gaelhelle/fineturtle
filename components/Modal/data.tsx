        FineTurtle is not an NFT project that is here to fit the

                        NFTs beyond mere artwork and merchandise.

                        innovation that will completely revolutionize how real
                        estate operates. We will then enable them to benefit
                        from rewards and passive income that will be generated
                        from tokenized real estate.

                        Secondly, building a strong NFT community will go a long
                        way in spreading awareness of our project. This will
                        then help to fast-track progress globally towards the
                        adoption of tokenized real estate as a valid revenue and
                        operational model for individuals and businesses in both
